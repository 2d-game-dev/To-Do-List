# To-Do-List

This is a simple **To-Do List** web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It allows you to:
- ✅ Create new tasks
- 🗑️ Delete selected tasks
- 🟢 Mark tasks as **done**
- 🟡 Mark tasks as **partially done**
- 🌙 Toggle between **dark and light themes**
- 💾 Save all tasks using **localStorage** (so your tasks persist even after a page reload)
